## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramanakumar05/Aws-project1.git
cd Aws-project1
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file using the `.env.example` provided:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
```

Then run the backend:

```bash
node app.js
```

Or with PM2:

```bash
pm2 start app.js --name backend
```

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend/my-app
npm install
npm run build
```

Serve the frontend using:

```bash
npx serve -s build -l 3000
```

Or with PM2:

```bash
pm2 start "npx serve -s build -l 3000" --name frontend
```

## 🌐 Accessing the App

If hosted on EC2, visit:

```
http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:3000
```

Ensure the correct ports (3000, 5000) are open in your EC2 security group settings.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Example `.env`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
JWT_SECRET=mySuperSecretKey
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
```
